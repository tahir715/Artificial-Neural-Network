# My Project Title

## Description
This project demonstrates how to load, preprocess, and utilize the Car Evaluation dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using PyTorch. The dataset consists of categorical attributes related to car evaluation, which we will encode and convert into tensors for model training.

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, run the following commands:

bash
pip install ucimlrepo
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
Usage
Here's an example of how to fetch and use the Car Evaluation dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

python
Copy code
from ucimlrepo import fetch_ucirepo 

# Fetch dataset
car_evaluation = fetch_ucirepo(id=19) 

# Data (as pandas dataframes)
X = car_evaluation.data.features 
y = car_evaluation.data.targets 

# Metadata
print(car_evaluation.metadata) 

# Variable information
print(car_evaluation.variables) 
To verify your PyTorch installation, you can check its version with the following code:

python
Copy code
import torch
print(torch.__version__)
Loading and Encoding the Car Evaluation Dataset
You can load and encode the dataset using the following code:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import torch
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Step 1: Load dataset from the specified file path
df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\Haier\Desktop\car.data", header=None)

# Step 2: Assign column names to the dataset
df.columns = ['buying', 'maint', 'doors', 'persons', 'lug_boot', 'safety', 'class']

# Step 3: Separate features (x) and target (y)
x = df.drop(columns=['class'])  # 'class' is the target in the Car Evaluation dataset
y = df['class']

# Step 4: Convert categorical variables in 'x' using one-hot encoding
x = pd.get_dummies(x, drop_first=True)  # One-hot encode categorical features

# Step 5: Convert both x and y to NumPy arrays and then to PyTorch tensors
x_tensor = torch.tensor(x.values, dtype=torch.float32)  # Features to float32 tensor
y_tensor = torch.tensor(LabelEncoder().fit_transform(y), dtype=torch.float32)  # Target to float32 tensor

# Print to check if everything is converted properly
print("X Tensor Shape:", x_tensor.shape)
print("Y Tensor Shape:", y_tensor.shape)
Creating DataLoader for Model Training
You can create a DataLoader to prepare your data for training with the following code:

python
Copy code
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Step 1: Create a TensorDataset from x_tensor and y_tensor
dataset = TensorDataset(x_tensor, y_tensor)

# Step 2: Create a DataLoader with batch size of 32, and shuffle the data
data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Step 3: Iterate through one batch of data
for batch_x, batch_y in data_loader:
    print("Batch X (features):", batch_x)
    print("Batch Y (targets):", batch_y)
    break  # Break after first batch to only print the first batch
