This repository showcases a project that demonstrates the loading, preprocessing, and utilization of the Car Evaluation dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using PyTorch. The Car Evaluation dataset consists of categorical attributes related to car evaluations, which we encode and convert into tensors for model training.
